	Abstract = {This study extends economic models of the joint decisions of living arrangement and home ownership. The cost of shelter is an important factor in determining whether youth live independently (apart from parents and other non-related adults), and the cost of home ownership relative to renting is important to the tenure decision (choice of owning or renting). Simulations suggest that the post-1985 decline and eventual removal of the Australian subsidy for first-time home owners has lowered the home ownership rate among young households by 23 per cent, the equivalent of slowing the time to first ownership by two years.},

	Abstract = {The decision to remain in or leave the parental home represents the first housing career choice of young people. In this paper, we examine the parental home leaving outcomes for Australian birth cohorts in the twentieth century using recall questions contained in the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia Survey. The findings from survival analysis and hazard function modelling is that a continuous, gradual reduction in the age of first leaving the parental home in Australia is evident up to the 1947-51 birth cohort, followed by stability and then a rise in age of first leaving home for the most recent birth cohorts. Birth cohort effects remain significant even after other measured determinants of parental home leaving are taken into account. The paper confirms the strong roles that education, family background and ethnicity have on parental home leaving outcomes.},

The econometric estimates support the predictions of the theory. In particular, tighter housing markets, as indicated by higher regional relative house prices, significantly retard home leaving, especially the formation of partnerships, and encourage returns to the parental home. Young people with larger current income are more likely to leave, but less likely to return to, the parental home.},

Drawing upon the European Community Household Panel, we explore the impacts of various factors that affect daughters' and sons' home-leaving decisions. Our results show important differences across genders as well as across countries. The decisions of daughters appear to be more responsive than sons' to family structure as well as to institutional factors such as the labor and the mortgage market.},

	Abstract = {This paper proposes a model in which house prices are determined by economy-wide nominal income and nominal mortgage payments in the short run, while being determined by acquisition costs in the long run. The model, to a large extent, explains the 1995--2007 housing market run-up in the OECD countries by lower mortgage repayments, decreasing nominal interest rates, and increasing nominal GDP, partly induced by a large inflow of migrants. Empirical estimates give strong support for the model and suggest that it explains house prices in the OECD better than alternative models.},

	Abstract = {We systematically compare differences in recent Australian income inequality estimates derived from tax records and survey data. We use customised tax tables provided by the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) to more precisely measure Australian top incomes as conceptualised in the international top incomes literature. We then document the inability of Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) survey data, as well as the ATO 1% sample tax files, to replicate our top income share values. In contrast, accuracy is substantially improved using the ATO 2% sample introduced in 2011-12. Using HILDA data with enhanced income values from the 2% sample we better track top incomes. More importantly, we are able to use alternative income concepts and income-sharing units to provide more consistent cross-national comparisons than are currently found in the top incomes literature. Furthermore, we improve standard summary measure estimates of inequality found in the traditional survey-based Australian literature. Our findings show great potential value in linking tax records and survey data, but also show that this value is severely limited when using the 1% tax sample available for 2003-04 to 2010-11. Whereas the 2% sample substantially improves top incomes estimates, data without censored and perturbed income variables are needed and could be provided without unduly threatening tax filer confidentiality.},

	Abstract = {We report supply elasticity estimates of residential property (houses and apartments) for local government areas (LGAs) in metropolitan Sydney. Using annual data for 1991--2012, the average supply elasticity estimate across all LGAs is 0.2 for houses and 0.8 for apartments. The supply of houses is inelastic in all 43 LGAs; in contrast, apartment supply is elastic -- greater than unity -- in about one-third of LGAs. We develop theoretical and empirical models to explain the cross-section variation in supply elasticity across LGAs. For houses, supply elasticity is negatively related to an LGA's population density, the time taken by a local council to process a development application and to different measures of the amount of land in an LGA that is unavailable for new housing development. In contrast to houses, variation in supply elasticity for apartments across LGAs is unrelated to any of the available regressors.},

Maximum likelihood estimates for a simple version of this model suggests similar income risk, but higher consumption insurance relative to the partial information moments-based estimates in Blundell, Pistaferri, and Preston (2008) for the same panel dataset. Bayesian model comparison supports this simple version of the model that only allows a spillover from permanent income to permanent consumption, but assumes no cointegration and no persistence in transitory components. However, consumption insurance and income risk estimates are highly robust across different specifications.},

	Abstract = {In this paper, we estimate a model of housing demand with neighbourhood effects. We exploit special features of the national sample of the American Housing Survey and properties of housing markets that allow us to create `natural' instruments and therefore identify the impact of social interactions. We find evidence of both endogenous and contextual neighbourhood effects. We report two alternative sets of estimates for neighbourhood effects that differ in terms of the instruments we use for estimating the model. When the endogenous neighbourhood effect is large the respective contextual effects are weak, and vice versa. The elasticity of housing demand with respect to the mean of the neighbours' housing demands (the endogenous effect) ranges from 0.19 to 0.66 and is generally very significant. The contextual effects are also very significant. A key such effect, the elasticity with respect to the mean of neighbours' permanent incomes, ranges from 0.17 to 0.54.

	Abstract = {Homeownership rates have increased significantly in many OECD countries over recent decades. Using micro-econometric decomposition techniques, this paper shows that part of this increase can be explained by changes in the characteristics of households, including age, household structure, income and education. Nevertheless, a significant portion of the change in homeownership rates remains unexplained by shifts in household characteristics, leaving a potential role for public policy in explaining developments in homeownership rates. Panel estimates suggest that the relaxation of down-payment constraints on mortgage loans has increased homeownership rates among credit-constrained households over recent decades, resulting in a rise in the aggregate homeownership rate that is comparable with the impact of population ageing. In countries where tax relief on mortgage debt financing is generous, however, the expansionary impact of mortgage market innovations on homeownership is smaller. This is consistent with the tendency for such housing tax relief to be capitalised into real house prices, which may crowd-out some financially constrained households from homeownership at the margin. The impact of housing policies regulating the functioning of the rental market, such as rent regulation and provisions for tenure security, on tenure choice is also explored.},

Particular attention is given to assessing the significance of the user cost of owner-occupied housing for tenure decisions. Using cross-sectional data from a 1991 housing survey, this study shows that including user costs in the tenure choice model results in a substantial improvement in goodness-of-fit, but also causes the marginal probability for permanent income to become negative. It is suggested that this may reflect a tendency for higher income groups in the two cities to live in inner locations where renting is more common because prices are high relative to rents.},

Given a housing consumption plan, we show that a decrease in the covariance between a household's earnings and housing rents increases the likelihood of ownership. A household who plans to remain in its home over a long period is more likely to own; a household who plans to remain in its home over a short period is more likely to rent. The higher the covariance between the user cost of a home and that of other properties a household is likely to consider in the future, the more likely the household is to own this home. These predictions of our model find support in recent empirical studies.},

Decomposition techniques based on tenure choice models are used to provide evidence of changing homeownership patterns in Australia between 1975 and 1994. The results indicate a distinct change in home-ownership propensities which is neither uniform across age-groups, nor uniform for different household types with both the same and with different levels of income. A number of tentative explanations are proposed, each of which provides the basis for further research on the factors affecting household tenure decisions.

	Abstract = {While many studies have investigated the determinants of housing demand, very few studies have focused on how economic conditions affect the formation of potential households directly. Potential households may choose to delay entry into the housing market by remaining with one's parents during times of economic hardship or by combining with other persons to share housing costs. Using a variety of modeling approaches, we find that both the increase in the unemployment rate and the presence of recessions reduce the rate of household formation. Simulations suggest that these declines are substantively important. For example, in a recession, the likelihood that a young adult will form an independent household falls by 1--9% points depending on the age of the person. By way of comparison, if an individual is unemployed, the likelihood of leaving the parental home is up to 11% points lower.},

``The current evidence is also inconclusive concerning the impact of housing prices and rents on the timing of household formation. ''- proceeds to list research on the topic.

At present, there are only two papers that test whether local labor market conditions influence household formation rates.

Housing price risk can be substantial but, unlike other risky assets which people can avoid, most people want to eventually own their home thereby creating an insurance demand early in life. Our contribution focuses on the importance of home ownership as a hedge against future house price risk for individuals that plan to move up the housing ladder. We use a simple theoretical model to show that people living in places with higher housing price risk should own their first home at a younger age, live in larger homes, and be less likely to refinance. These predictions are shown to hold using panel data from the United States and United Kingdom.},

We use data covering the years 2001 to 2011, a period which encompasses the boom, bubble and collapse in the Irish housing market. We find that the household formation decision is affected by the rent-to-income ratio while tenure choice depends upon the difference between rent and the user cost of housing, a notional cost of services derived from owning a home. After the crash, the balance of these costs favoured renting, resulting in a decrease in owner occupancy. In addition, we find that falling average rents caused entry to the housing market to become more affordable, and that this is linked to significantly higher household formation rates.},

	Abstract = {Quantifying the real economy effects of macroprudential policy is important at a time when such measures are increasingly being promoted as central to the prevention of future credit and house price bubbles. Recently, like other regulatory authorities, the Irish central bank introduced regulatory limits on mortgage lending aimed at protecting greater financial stability. In this paper, we seek to examine some of the wider implications of these measures for tenure choice in the Irish housing market. We find that a reduction in the loan-to-value ratio, such as may occur as a result of regulatory limits, will lead to a greater demand for rental accommodation, prompting higher rents for a given house price level. While this result is somewhat incidental to financial stability, it does have significant implications for housing policy, particularly, at a time when the Irish housing market is confronted by an acknowledged supply shortage.},

The HFCS is an invaluable resource for policy makers, allowing for household-level analysis of the composition of wealth and debt, leverage and the debt-service burden. Highlights include: the household main residence accounts for the majority of most households' gross wealth (48 per cent on average);  nancial assets account for a much smaller proportion of gross wealth on average (13 per cent); more than half of households hold some form of debt, with mortgage indebtedness proving to be a particularly heavy burden for younger cohorts; however, the mortgage repayment burden is more evenly spread across the age distribution, with younger borrowers bene ting from low interest rates and long mortgage terms; the median value of net wealth is €105,000, in line with other Euro area countries (€109,000); the top 20 per cent of households hold 70 per cent of net assets -- again, similar to the Euro area as whole; in Ireland, the concentration of wealth at the top end of the distribution is driven by two factors: larger holdings of real assets and relatively smaller holdings of debt.},

The indicator estimates a standardised rental index on a national, Dublin and outside of Dublin basis based on the 950,000 rental properties registered with the RTB. The provision in late 2016 of detailed geographical identifiers has enabled an alternative series of indicators to be estimated. In particular, hedonic rental indicators for 137 local electoral areas (LEAs) are now available on a quarterly basis from 2007 quarter 3 to 2016 quarter 4. By providing a more accurate assessment of regional trends in rental supply and demand, the indicators should enable a more precise implementation of policies in the rental market. They should also serve as a proxy for measuring underlying economic activity in these regions on an ongoing basis.},

This suggests that any decline in house prices would not cut consumption significantly.},

@techreport{dollman2015household,
	Abstract = {We document some new stylised facts about consumption and income inequality (or `economic inequality') among households in Australia. Based on household- level information from the Household Expenditure Survey we find that consumption inequality is lower on average than income inequality, but that income and consumption inequality have both increased a little since the early 1990s, with income inequality increasing by more. These findings are broadly similar to the changes in income and consumption inequality documented in other developed economies.
We provide insight into the welfare implications of these changes using panel data from the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia Survey. We decompose the broad trends in income inequality into four statistical components: (i) changes in observed household characteristics; (ii) changes in the returns to unobserved skills; (iii) changes in the size of persistent income shocks (reflecting events such as promotions and long-term unemployment); and (iv) changes in the size of transitory income shocks (reflecting events such as bonuses, short-term unemployment and short-term illness).
The reported trends in income inequality do not appear to be due to changes in observed household characteristics, but rather to changes in the size of persistent and transitory income shocks. Since the middle of the 2000s, at least some of the increase in income inequality has been due to persistent factors, a conclusion that is consistent with the rise in consumption inequality over the corresponding period.

Our estimates are conditioned on variations in local labor demand and income expectations as these may co-determine housing wealth and labor supply. We use renters as a control group and test for the potential endogeneity of tenure and location. We find significant housing wealth effects on labor supply among young married / co-habiting female owners and older male owners, consistent with leisure being a normal good. The size of these effects is economically important. Our estimates imply housing wealth effects have stronger effects then local labor market conditions upon participation decisions for these workers.

Wealth effects are identified from exogenous variation in local area housing prices, while controlling for variation in local labour demand conditions. The most quantitatively important responses were in labour force participation and weekly hours of work by women (both single and married), with clear life-cycle patterns. The effect for the older cohort of women is associated with early retirement for those experiencing above-average housing wealth gains. For younger women there was a reduction in hours of work in response to unexpected gains in housing wealth. The estimated wealth effects are consistent with leisure being a normal good.},

No evidence for `traditional housing wealth effects' is found, with young homeowners exhibiting the largest wealth effects. Young renters also exhibit a positive consumption response to house prices, although less so than young homeowners. This suggests that increasing house prices raise spending via easing credit constraints and a common association between house prices and a third factor. Results from a cohort-level panel are similar to those using household-level data, suggesting that `pseudo-panels' may be used as a partial substitute for actual panels.},

Alternative hypotheses have been put forward to explain this pattern. In this paper we test these hypotheses by using repeated Household Expenditure Surveys from Canada and Australia to identify the transmission mechanism that links consumption and household wealth. The empirical analysis suggests that neither a direct wealth effect nor a common causal factor is a likely explanation for the observed correlation between wealth and consumption. Rather, indirect factors such as relaxation of credit constraints are more likely explanations.},

Using four ABS Household Expenditures Surveys collected between 1975 and 1993, we compare trends in consumption and income inequality among Australian households. We find that consumption is much more equal than income. While there were significant increases in both income and consumption inequality, consumption inequality rose by much less. One interpretation of the results is that some income inequality in Australia reflects transitory fluctuations which households can smooth,`and that part of the growth in income inequality reflects an increase in these transitory fluctuations.},

Using administrative data from the Netherlands (2006-- 2010) that combine transaction data, house characteristics, and household characteristics of both buyers and sellers, the estimates indicate that a better financial position leads to higher prices for buyers and lower prices for sellers. It provides evidence that income and wealth influence housing market behavior of buyers and sellers. The results are consistent with theories that suggests that higher income and wealth lead to higher search and bargaining costs, implying that households with better financial positions invest less time and effort in search and bargaining leading to worse bargaining outcomes.},

What is the magnitude and nature of bequests and what role do they play in facilitating home ownership, changes in housing consumption or assisting home-buying households into outright home ownership? 2. What is the nature of inter vivos (financial and in-kind) transfers from older Australians to their children and what role do they play in facilitating sustainable housing outcomes? 3. What are the implications of intergenerational transfers for inequality and what are the likely consequences over time?

	Abstract = {Over the past two decades, a number of countries have experienced appreciation in house prices at the same time that aggregate consumption has increased. This paper tests alternative hypotheses for this phenomenon by using repeated household surveys from Australia and Canada to identify the transmission mechanism that links consumption and household wealth. The empirical analysis suggests that neither a direct wealth effect nor a common causal factor likely accounts for the observed correlation between wealth and consumption in these two countries. Rather, indirect factors such as collateral effects arising from relaxation of credit constraints are a more likely explanation.},

Evidence does not support other theories of a direct effect (e.g. home owners feel wealthier and spend more) or a common cause (no impact with renters or across age groups). Extensions would be to consider a period of house price decline or the credit channel in more detail.},

	Abstract = {Outright ownership is estimated to increase to be around 10 percentage points higher among bequest recipients compared to non-recipients among individuals aged 25--65 years of age. Though parental transfers or gifts tend to be smaller than bequests, large impacts of parental transfers on ownership rates are also identified. Such an outcome likely reflects the timing and purpose associated with inter vivos transfers.
First, it is clear that renters are less likely to receive transfers compared to those in home ownership. Moreover, the transfers that did occur over the period 2001--10 tended to increase overall inequality. While the analysis is largely descriptive in nature, it does flag the potential for wealth to become increasingly concentrated over time and the important role that housing and housing tenure may play in such an outcome.},
	Annote = {Main conclusions is that parental transfers have helped renters onto the property ladder and bequests have helped home owns pay down or off mortgages. These have driven greater inequality compared to no such transfers or bequests. Suggestions for further research are provided.

	Abstract = {We analyse the effect of housing wealth on household indebtedness for the period 2002 to 2014 in Australia. Overall we find that approximately one quarter of the growth in household debt during this period can be explained by rising house prices. This rise is mostly driven by the wealth effect associated with rising house prices, and a collateral effect which is present for households that are collateral and liquidity constrained. We uncover a weaker wealth effect for households that have faced negative shocks to income or employment which indicates precautionary behaviour.},
	Annote = {Increase in house prices have resulted in increases in debt levels. The changes correspond fairly well with the lifetime income model. Increases in debt are greater with those in middle age who are less constrained. Those who have experience an economic shock are less likelly to increase debt. },

We also argue that insurance data are particularly well suited to such empirical investigations. To illustrate this claim, we use data on contracts and accidents to investigate the extent of asymmetric information in the French market for automobile insurance. Using various parametric and nonparametric methods, we find no evidence for the presence of asymmetric information in this market.},

Economic theorists traditionally banish discussions of information to footnotes. Serious consideration of costs of communication, imperfect knowledge, and the like would, it is believed, complicate without informing. This paper, which analyzes competitive markets in which the characteristics of the commodities exchanged are not fully known to at least one of the parties to the transaction, suggests that this comforting myth is false. Some of the most important conclusions of economic theory are not robust to considerations of imperfect information.},

	Abstract = {Most markets clear through a sequence of sales rather than through a Walrasian auctioneer. Because buyers can decide whether to buy now or later, rather than only now or never, their current "willingness to pay" is much more sensitive to price than the demand curve is. A consequence is that markets will be extremely sensitive to new information, leading to both "frenzies," in which demand feeds on itself, and "crashes," in which price drops discontinuously. The paper also shows how a result from static auction theory, the revenue equivalence theorem, can be applied to solve for a dynamic price path. },

Were this relationship to hold for Ireland, it would predict falls of real house prices of 40 to 60 per cent over a period of 8 to 9 years. The unusually large size of the Irish house building industry suggest that any significant house price fall that does occur could impose a difficult adjustment on the economy.},

	Abstract = {This paper studies a quantitative general equilibrium model of housing. The model has two key elements not previously considered in existing quantitative macro studies of housing finance: aggregate business cycle risk and a realistic wealth distribution driven in the model by bequest heterogeneity in preferences. These features of the model play a crucial role in the following results. First, a relaxation of financing constraints leads to a large boom in house prices. Second, the boom in house prices is entirely the result of a decline in the housing risk premium. Third, low interest rates cannot explain high home values.},
