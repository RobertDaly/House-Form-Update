	Abstract = {This paper gives a short overview of Monte Carlo studies on theusefulness of Heckman's (1976, 1979) two-step estimator for estimating selectionmodels. Such models occur frequently in empirical work, especially in microeconometrics when estimating wage equations or consumer expenditures. It is shown that exploratory work to check for collinearity problems is strongly recommended before deciding on which estimator to apply. In the absence of collinearity problems, the full-information maximum likelihood estimator is preferable to the limited-information two-step method of Heckman, although the latter also gives reasonable results. If, however, collinearity problems prevail, subsample OLS (or the Two-Part Model) is the most robust amongst the simple-to-calculate estimators.},

@article{Atalay2016House,
	Abstract = {There is a strong relationship between house prices changes and household indebtedness. Together, these findings reveal that house price increases are associated with a reallocation of household debt from non-mortgage debt to mortgage debt.
There are important differences in the relationship between house prices and household indebtedness across demographic groups, and by level of debt holdings.
House price movements have clear and consistent impacts on labour market activities. The magnitude of the effect varies by gender, family type and life-cycle stage.

The cost of shelter is an important factor in determining whether youth live independently (apart from parents and other non-related adults), and the cost of home ownership relative to renting is important to the tenure decision (choice of owning or renting). Simulations suggest that the post-1985 decline and eventual removal of the Australian subsidy for first-time home owners has lowered the home ownership rate among young households by 23 per cent, the equivalent of slowing the time to first ownership by two years.},

	Abstract = {The decision to remain in or leave the parental home represents the first housing career choice of young people. In this paper, we examine the parental home leaving outcomes for Australian birth cohorts in the twentieth century using recall questions contained in the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia Survey. The findings from survival analysis and hazard function modelling is that a continuous, gradual reduction in the age of first leaving the parental home in Australia is evident up to the 1947-51 birth cohort, followed by stability and then a rise in age of first leaving home for the most recent birth cohorts. Birth cohort effects remain significant even after other measured determinants of parental home leaving are taken into account. The paper confirms the strong roles that education, family background and ethnicity have on parental home leaving outcomes.},

The article focuses on changing patterns of common family transitions - young adults leaving home, forming partnerships, having children, divorcing, repartnering - transitions that have profound effects on each family member and on the structure of the family as a whole. Tables and graphs provide key comparative statistics over time, for example: young men and women living with their parents; percentage of men and women aged 45-49 years who have ever married; age specific first marriage rates; fertility rates; divorce rates; family types; labour force partipation of married women and women with dependent children.},

	Abstract = {This paper employs the user cost of capital to examine Irish house price movements. The bundle of services afforded by a dwelling can be accessed either by renting the dwelling or
by outright purchase. Between 2002 and 2007, a combination of factors including rapid house price appreciation and the prevailing fiscal and monetary environment created a
strong bias towards homeownership. This was reflected in a negative user cost of housing as capital gains exceeded funding costs (both direct mortgage cost and the opportunity cost) thereby incentivising home ownership and fuelling further increases in prices. We find that the collapse in house prices since 2007 has contributed to a reversal of this process. From
mid-2007 onwards, the user cost has soared as capital losses have greatly exceeded the funding costs (albeit falling) causing house prices to fall further. Both fiscal and financial
policy measures which could enable a more efficient functioning of the housing market are
discussed.},

This paper reviews the developing economics literature surrounding young people's decisions to continue living in their parents' homes in order to begin to assess the causes and consequences of this decision. In particular, co-residence with parents appears to be an important form of intergenerational support for young adults. It is important to understand the extent to which young people rely on this form of support as they complete their education, enter the labour market and establish themselves as independent adults. Specific attention is paid to the ways in which Australian income support, education and housing policies may influence these patterns.},

We use data covering the years 2001 to 2011, a period which encompasses the boom, bubble and collapse in the Irish housing market. We find that the household formation decision is affected by the rent-to-income ratio while tenure choice depends upon the difference between rent and the user cost of housing, a notional cost of services derived from owning a home. After the crash, the balance of these costs favoured renting, resulting in a decrease in owner occupancy. In addition, we find that falling average rents caused entry to the housing market to become more affordable, and that this is linked to significantly higher household formation rates.},

@article{lee2013happens,
	Abstract = {While many studies have investigated the determinants of housing demand, very few studies have focused on how economic conditions affect the formation of potential households directly. Potential households may choose to delay entry into the housing market by remaining with one's parents during times of economic hardship or by combining with other persons to share housing costs. Using a variety of modeling approaches, we find that both the increase in the unemployment rate and the presence of recessions reduce the rate of household formation. Simulations suggest that these declines are substantively important. For example, in a recession, the likelihood that a young adult will form an independent household falls by 1-9\% points depending on the age of the person. By way of comparison, if an individual is unemployed, the likelihood of leaving the parental home is up to 11\% points lower.},
