# House Formation Thesis Update
This git has the R scripts and the Latex files for updating my 2018 Household formation thesis with the latest data for publication.
When the R scripts run they need an output directory. This output is not stored in the git hub and can be recreated as needed by running the scripts.  Note the output directory contains 'tex' files that are created by R and the used in the Latex file.
